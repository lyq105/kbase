== Multiscale finite element method ==

=== Main propurse ===
This methods discussed in this book attempt to <b>capture the multiscale 
structure of the solution via localized basis functions</b>. 

these basis functions contain essential multiscale information to provide a
faithful approximation of the solution.

=== Two types of multiscale processes: === 
* The first type is the process which has scale separation.
	* In this case, the small-scale information is captured via local multiscale basis functions computed based only on the information within local regions (coarse-scale grid blocks).
* The second type of multiscale processes do not have apparent scale separation.  

MsFEMs consist of two major ingredients: multiscale basis functions and
a global numerical formulation that couples these multiscale basis functions.
