==Classifications of thin plates ==

*Defination 1* : Thin plates are initially flat structural memebers bounded by two parallel
planes, called _faces_, and a cylindrical surface, called an _eage of boundary_.

*Defination 2*: The distance between the plane faces is called the
 _thickness_$(h)$ of the plate.

Plates may be classified into three groups according to the ratio $a/h$, where
$a$ is a typical dimension of plates in a plane and $h$ is a plate thickness.
These groups are 

# Thick plates: the ratios $a/h \le 8 \ldots 10$. The analysis of such bodies
	using the general equations of three-dimensional elasticity.
# Membranes: the ratios $a/h \ge 80 \ldots 100$. 
# Thin plates: the ratio $8 \ldots 10 \le a/h \ge 80 \ldots 100$.

Thin plate may also be subdivided into two different classes by the ratio $w/h$ 
which is the ratio of the maximum deflection of the plate to its
thickness.

The first class is _Stiff Plates_ : A plate can be classified as a stiff 
palte if $w/h \le 0.2$.

The second class is _Flexible plates_: if the plate deflections are
beyond a certain level, $w/h \ge 0.3$, then the lateral deflections
will be accompanied by stretching of the middle seuface.
